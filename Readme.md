the card will have a default value of 0, the value is its balance. To test in IRB, we would like to make an instance (os) of Oystercard, and check to see its default balance. I would then like to add money to this balance. To check in IRB: using (os) instance, with add_money to see if balance increases (default_balance + add_money(value)).
